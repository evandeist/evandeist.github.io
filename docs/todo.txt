Tasks:
- Waterfall
- Gyrofighter Video
- write blurb for home page
- laser doodle video

Fixes:   
- black bars on project thumbnails
    - project titles that are too long get split across 2 lines. 
    - make project titles move up instead of extending the card
- fix contact page on mobile (query for portrait/landsacpe?)


Nitpicks:
- different font style
- contact icons too big on mobile (use clamp)
- larger body font
- order the projects by importance
- home page p5js is too distracting?
