This is an educational fire pump simulation to help train Fire Protection Engineering students at UMD. On a real fire pump, closing the wrong valve at the wrong time can cause some serious trouble. This virtual version prepares students for the real deal.

This simulation is built in Unity and includes a both a warehouse and fire pump room. The warehouse contains various pipes, valves, and clamps that students must learn the function of. 

The pump room contains a fire pump, which students can control using the electirc pump controller and valves. They can test the pump using the header and canvas hoses outside.

Below is a link to the game, though it may not be very fun if you don't know what you're doing!
