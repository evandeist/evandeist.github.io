This is an educational fire pump simulation to help train Fire Protection Engineering students at UMD. On a real fire pump, closing the wrong valve at the wrong time can cause some serious trouble. This virtual version prepares students for the real deal.

Below is a link to the game, though it may not be very fun if you don't know what you're doing!
