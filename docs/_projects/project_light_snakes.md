A classic 4-player snake game on Nintendo Switch!
Entrap your opponents, and be the last player remaining to win.

I wrote his game using smileBASIC 4 - a programming software where you can create and share games on Nintendo Switch. 
The programming language is a version of BASIC called smileBASIC, which is tailored to game development on Nintendo systems.

The game can be downloaded in smileBASIC 4 using this public key: <em>4EEK3W88V</em>

Gameplay is inspired by the browser game <a href="https://www.games1729.com/serpentron/">Serpentron</a>
