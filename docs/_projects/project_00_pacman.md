The arcade classic, faithfully recreated from the ground-up!

This project began as a way to familiarize myself with the godot game engine, 
but I was quickly fascinated by the mechanical intricacies of the original game. 
I decided to try a remake that was as close to the original as possible.

Nearly every detail has been carefully recreated: the animations, cornering system, ghost AI, and even some of the original glitches!
Special thanks to the <a href="https://pacman.holenet.info/">Pac Man Dossier</a> for dissecting the original game
