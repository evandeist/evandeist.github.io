Doodle on the wall using a laser pointer! 

This Processing 4 sketch requires both a camera and a projector. The program scans the pixels of the camera feed to estimate the position of the pointer, then draws that position onto the screen. The screen is then projected onto the wall. If everything is calibrated right, the result feels like magic! 

There is a mirror brush, which lets you draw symmetrical forms:

and a "Conway" brush, which lets you place cells in a <a href="https://playgameoflife.com/">Game of Life</a> simulation:
