<img src="gyro_gameplay.PNG" alt="gyrofighter gameplay">

An Asteroids-like game, with a twist! This mobile game requires the player to physically tilt their device to maneuver the ship. It's a simple and intuitive control scheme, but quite difficult to master! The gyro can be "recalibrated" by tapping the button in the bottom left.

This app was developed in collaboration the excellent @brysonfoye.
It was the final project for a handheld programming course (CMSC436), and is written in the Swift language.
