A digital marble labyrinth on a 64x64 LED board! 
As with a regular labyrinth, just tilt the board to roll the marble toward the goal.

This arduino project uses a 6-axis IMU (Interial Measurement Unit) to detect tilt. 
The greatest challenge was acheiving natrual motion on such a limited display. It took a lot of optimizations to get it running smoothly.
